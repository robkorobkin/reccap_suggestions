The ARMS software sold by RecoveryOutcomes.com does some things really well, but the user interface leaves much to be desired. I'm a coder who now owns a 24-bed low barrier recovery residence in Maine, and I use the ARMS system every day. I created this repo to demo out some ideas I have for interfaces, which would be really helpful to me in ways that the current screens, put simply, are not. I'd love to speak with folks at the firm and discuss my experiences.
